      <h1>What about Dom?</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>I am Dom. I live in Cleveland, Ohio where I've lived my whole life. Currently I am going to Cuyhoga Community Collge chasing after an associates degree in "IT programming and development." I work part-time as a barista at Starbucks. I love to learn about anything, really. Especially programming, there is so much to learn and it is something that you can constantly be learning some new aspect of it. Right now HTML, CSS and JavaScript are my first languages that I am learning. Head over to the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page to see what I've done. While you're there take a stroll through my <a href="blog.html">blog</a> page to track my journey through programming and becoming the fullstack developer that I will one day be. </p>
